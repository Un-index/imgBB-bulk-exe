## imgBB-bulk-exe

You can use this small tool to mass download images from [imgBB](https://imgbb.com/) from their urls,
I made this because there's no other utility available for this purpose (since the img url points to the download page and not the image, other image downloaders will not work).

(you can use the **web-based easy to use** version from https://deontic.github.io/imgBB-web-bulk-downloader/, or use the npm package from https://github.com/deontic/imgbb-bulk, also note that the web-based version and the npm version will save your files with their **original** names, but since it is too much work this version will set part of the url as the filename instead)



## Instructions
* download the exe file in /bin/imgBB-bulk.exe and run it (if falsely detected as a virus, ignore the warning and whitelist the exe file and run it again)


* press the copy button on your imgBB upload page to copy all urls, then paste them directly into the textbox in the app window 
* hit the download button

the window will close automatically once your images are downloaded
