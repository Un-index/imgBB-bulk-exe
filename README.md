## imgBB-bulk-exe

You can use this tool to mass download images from [imgBB](https://imgbb.com/) from their urls,
I made this because there's no other utility available for this purpose.

(you can also use the npm package from https://github.com/Un-index/imgbb-bulk)



## Instructions
* download the exe file in /bin/imgBB-bulk.exe and run it

* press the copy button on your imgBB upload page to copy all urls, then paste them directly into the textbox in the app window 
* hit the download button

the window will close automatically once your images are downloaded
